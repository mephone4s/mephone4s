<sub> im like 99% sure rentry is hacked right now incase you are unaware, it's being very sketchy.....   
i'd recommend not opening **any** rentry links, you might end up downloading a virus soo stay safe    
also, if you have one, take your rentry off your profile to avoid giving someone else a virus ðŸ˜º<sub/>
